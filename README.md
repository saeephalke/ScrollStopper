# Welcome to Scroll Stopper

Thanks for checking out Scroll Stopper, a Chrome Extension that stops you from scrolling addictive sites by encouraging you to engage in activities you actually enjoy.

Scroll Stopper is here to stop you from wasting time on addictive sites and get you focusing on your priorities or spending time on things that give you fulfillment. Below are various features Scroll Stopper provides, as well as how to download it.



## Features

The UI is split between three different cards

### Card #1 Time Tracker

Shows the amount of time you've spent on the following sites:
* YouTube
* TikTok
* Instagram
* Facebook 
<p>No setup needed on your end, it'll automatically track your time on these sites and store them locally in Chrome</p>

### Card #2 Wishlist

A list of things you'd rather be doing than scrolling. This list is personalized to you, and you can even check off the items once you're done with them. 

### Card #3 Wishlist Adder

Allows you to add your own items, which will show up in **Card #2**. All new items added also get stored locally using Chrome's storage.

### Redirection 

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f79bb24-8606-44e3-833c-6414823b40b6

Whenever you visit **YouTube**, **TikTok**, **Instagram**, or **Facebook**, you'll be redirected to the Scroll Stopper tab. This feature is deliberately *annoying* so that you'll be encouraged to spend your time away from these sites.
