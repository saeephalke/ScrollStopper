# Welcome to Scroll Stopper

Thanks for checking out Scroll Stopper, a Chrome Extension that stops you from scrolling addictive sites by encouraging you to engage in activities you actually enjoy.

Scroll Stopper is here to stop you from wasting time on addictive sites and get you focusing on your priorities or spending time on things that give you fulfillment. Below are various features Scroll Stopper provides, as well as how to download it.

Version 1.0.1 is now available!

2. Once you unzip the folder, go to `chrome://extensions/` and turn on `Developer Mode` on the upper right corner.

## Features

The UI is split between four different cards

### Card #1 Time Tracker

Shows the amount of time you've spent on Scroll Sites you want to avoid
No setup needed on your end, it'll automatically track your time on these sites and store them locally in Chrome. Time won't be updated live, and instead will be updated when you switch tabs or reactivate tabs and spend more than 5 seconds on a tracked tab. This is for the sake of your computer's energy resources. 

### Card #2 Wishlist

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6cc6abe-d538-4a59-8d2f-550e5597e670

A list of things you'd rather be doing than scrolling. This list is personalized to you, and you can even check off the items once you're done with them. 

### Card #3 Wishlist Adder

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de37aeba-20e0-49d1-81bd-4276f29e8b06

Allows you to add your own items, which will show up in **Card #2**. All new items added also get stored locally using Chrome's storage.

### Card #4 Scroll Site Editor

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d743884-6cbc-42d0-aa5a-b47e37861a58

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70b7bb8-4d2f-4ebf-adde-5b6c0e18f43b

Allows you to add and remove Scroll Sites. Make sure to enter the exact domain name, including www. if the site uses it (e.g., www.instagram.com for Instagram or lichess.org for Lichess). **Do not include https://, http://, or anything after the .com, .org, etc.** If you removed a site and then added it back, **your previous time will not be reset** (don't get sneaky here, your time wasted will never be forgotten). 

### Redirection 

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f79bb24-8606-44e3-833c-6414823b40b6

Whenever you visit your Scroll Sites, you'll be redirected to the Scroll Stopper tab. This feature is deliberately *annoying* so that you'll be encouraged to spend your time away from these sites.

## Feedback

Feel free to post any Issues or suggestions for later releases of Scroll Stopper. Hopefully I'm not everlastingly scrolling on the web and will have the time to fix them ;)
